# java-basic-paint
A basic paint program written in java that utilizes array lists to store coordinates of mouse events as points.
Features simple functionalities such as: choosing different colors, drawing rectangles, clearing the application of all drawings, and more.

#### To draw a rectangle, select the appropriate menu item and drag from the desired starting corner to the desired ending corner.

This is a side project that I felt like attempting after finishing a course that first introduced me to java.
